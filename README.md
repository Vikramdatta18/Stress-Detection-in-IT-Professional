# Stress Detection in IT Professionals

## Overview
Stress has become a critical concern among IT professionals due to long working hours, tight deadlines, and high cognitive demands.  
This project focuses on detecting stress levels in IT professionals using data-driven and machine learning–based approaches. The objective is to analyze relevant features and build predictive models that can classify or estimate stress levels effectively.

## Objectives
- Analyze stress-related data of IT professionals
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for stress detection
- Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains features related to work conditions, mental health indicators, and other relevant factors affecting stress levels in IT professionals.

> **Note:**  
> Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/`) and update file paths in the code if required.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding and scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical analysis
   - Data visualization
3. **Model Training**
   - Machine learning algorithms such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (if applicable)
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix

## Results
The trained models are evaluated and compared to identify the most effective approach for stress detection.  
Results and visualizations are available in the `results/` directory or within the notebooks.
