# Stress Detection in IT Professionals

## Overview

Stress is a critical concern among IT professionals due to long working hours, tight deadlines, and high cognitive demands. This project focuses on detecting stress levels in IT professionals using data-driven and machine learning–based approaches. The goal is to analyze relevant features and build predictive models that can classify or estimate stress levels effectively.

## Objectives

- Analyze stress-related data of IT professionals  
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for stress detection  
- Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics  

## Tech Stack

- **Programming language:** Python  
- **Libraries & tools:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset contains features related to work conditions, mental health indicators, and other relevant factors affecting stress levels in IT professionals.

> **Note:**  
> Place the dataset in the `data/` directory (or appropriate location) and update file paths in the code if required.

## Methodology

1. **Data preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature encoding and scaling  

2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical analysis  
   - Data visualization  

3. **Model training**
   - Machine learning algorithms such as:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine (if applicable)  

4. **Model evaluation**
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion matrix  

## Results

The trained models are evaluated and compared to identify the most effective approach for stress detection. Results and visualizations are available in the `results/` directory or within the Jupyter notebooks.
