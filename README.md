Stress Detection in IT Professionals
Overview
Stress is a critical concern among IT professionals due to long working hours, tight deadlines, and high cognitive demands. This project focuses on detecting stress levels in IT professionals using data-driven and machine learning–based approaches. The goal is to analyze relevant features and build predictive models that can classify or estimate stress levels effectively.

Objectives
